Version: 0.2.5
Date: 3. 05. 2024
  Balance Changes:
    - Science costs significantly reduced for higher level sciences
    - raw resource creation recipes crafting time 8 -> 6 seconds 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.4
Date: 1. 05. 2024
  General:
    - Fish Transmutation devices are now indestructible and can be used in blueprints
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.3
Date: 22. 04. 2024
  General:
    - added stone recipe. How did I forget this before?
  Bugfixes:
    - matched setting name to key

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.2
Date: 22. 04. 2024
  Bugfixes:
    - essential bugfixes

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.0
Date: 22. 04. 2024
  Features:
    - Transmutation Device recipes produce a fixed rate of 20 fish per second regardless of input recipe. 
  Bugfixes:
    - fish transmutation recipes no longer produce an abysmal surplus. It should produce at least 1.5x the value of the item put in
  Balance Changes:
    - numerous recipe value changes. 
    - raw resource production recipes are now much more expensive since fish can be acquired easier
    - transmutation device pollution/minute 100->200
    - transmutation device now has 4 module slots
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.1 
Date: 17. 04. 2024
  Balance Changes:
    - changed the numbers in the fish cost evaluation algorithm
    - raw resource recipes in furnaces now produce 2 per craft
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.0 
Date: 16. 04. 2024
  General:
    - Changed fish transmutation device asset to a recoloured version of nuclear reactor remnants
    - Added 5 new recipes for creating each raw resource from fish. Can be found in furnaces
    - Changed furnaces to work like assembling machines to accomodate the above change
    - Assembly machine pollution multiplier now doubles pollution by default. Can be changed in settings
    - Transmutation Devices now create pollution at a rate of 100/m, equal to 10 miners. 

  Balance Changes:
    - reduced biter time factor to 25 by default for biter evolution, to allow for the slower early game
    - doubled fish recipe values for copper and iron, left it the same for coal and stone. Iron and copper ore are value 1 now while coal and stone are value 0.5
    - fish now have a recipe value of one
    - algorithm value for complexity increased to 0.05
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.0 Fishmode (cakem), 0.0.0 Fishmode plus
Date: 04. 04. 2024
  Features:
    - Transmutation devices consume fish as a fuel source.
    - Transmutation devices can be affected by modules.
    - If you have lots of fish to spare, you can now craft your own Transmutation devices.
  Balancing:
    - Complete rework of the formula used to determine trasmutation fish results. The new formula emphasizes complexity over raw ingredient value.
    - Science packs require a lot less fish.
