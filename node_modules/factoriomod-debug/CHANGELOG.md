* fix debugging data stage after entrypoint changes
* allow extra args to factorio
* evaluate names for most variables

## 0.17.7

* stepIgnoreAll(t) function to ignore all functions in table
* __DebugAdapter.print() supports `{...}` to fill varargs in string.
* escape 13 in breakpoints
* omit frame source for C functions in call stack
* break-on-exception in most events and improved entrypoint identification
* warn if mod registers probably-incomplete sets of events
* jump to location in stacktrace works

## 0.17.5

* mark various internals as stepIgnore
* binary format for breakpoints, divided up one file per command, to fit better in 250 char limit of debug.debug()
* more consistently update breakpoints before resuming execution

## 0.17.4

* include for loop internals in `<temporaries>` section
* bring my own json to remove many dependencies on `game` object
* optimizations
* name `(main chunk)` in stack traces
* set breakpoints earlier (still can't attach before `game` is available though)
* varargs sorted into special child of Local scope, after fixed args
* automatically install and enable/disable mod
* works if `require`d into data or settings stage
* accumulate stderr until newline, then strip debug prompts and return non-empty strings
* better handling of paths
* "Factorio Mod Debug" output channel listing various info about what paths it found
* detect `mod-list.json` inside workspace and use its location as modsPath

## 0.17.3

* don't remove leading '/' from workspace paths on non-windows
* better path guess on mac
* don't try to instrument remote.call during on_load

## 0.17.2

* more improved escaping

* top level scope for factorio `global`
* filter temporaries to special child of Local scope
* filter "built in" globals to special child of Global scope
* fix display of eval _ENV
* unquote string keys when possible in table describe

## 0.17.1

* docs improvements
