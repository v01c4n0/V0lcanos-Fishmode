[mod-setting-description]
fishblock-seed=Seed used to generate recipes.
use-normal-mapgen=Keep the factorio original map generation.
assembling-machine-pollution-multiplier=pollution multiplier used to balance pollution compared to vanilla. 1 keeps them at vanilla values
fish-value-multiplier=determines the overall scaling for fish in recipes. The higher the number, the more fish items need, the lower it is, the less they will need. Very low values will make many items use 1 fish because the recipes are rounded to the nearest fish
visible-liquidate-multiplier=Transmutation multiplier is the amount of fish that you get out relative to the amount of fish that item is valued at. Higher transmutation multiplier = more item/s and more efficiency per item
